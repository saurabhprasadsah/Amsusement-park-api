Subject: Request for Compensation Due to ACH Return Charges

Dear {{Crio Support Team}},

I hope this email finds you well. I am reaching out regarding the multiple ACH return charges incurred on my account due to repeated auto-mandate attempts by Crio.

I had enrolled in {{Course Name}} but decided to cancel on the same day after reviewing the course content. However, my cancellation was processed only after two months, during which auto-mandate attempts were made, resulting in multiple ACH return charges due to insufficient funds.

Due to my financial condition at that time, I had to sell my iPad, yet the EMI was deducted before my refund was processed. While I eventually received the refund after two months, the repeated mandate attempts caused unnecessary financial strain.

Given this situation, I request compensation for the ACH return charges deducted from my account. I believe this issue arose due to the delayed cancellation process on Crioâ€™s end, and I hope for a fair resolution.

Please let me know how this can be addressed. I look forward to your prompt response.

Best regards,  
Pranav
